# Lorem Ipsum Generator

This application demonstrates basic usage of nodejs in creating dynamic websites. The instructions for the project are available on Treehouse.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/loremIpsumGenerator.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd loremIpsumGenerator`
- There are no project packages to install for this app since it uses just node.js. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.12.0 and above.
- Npm for package management, this comes with node.
Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to v8.12.0, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

Nothing to install peeps, just run `node app.js` inside the app directory and visit `localhost:8000`.


## Running the tests

This app has no tests, it's just for learning purposes.
